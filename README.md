# Ai Educational Assistant 
This project is an intelligent tutoring system me and my college team built as part of an undergraduate research program. The goal is to use machine learning to create a more personalized learning experience for students at UFRRJ.

Our work involve collecting, cleaning and preparing educational datasets, then using Python libraries to build and test models. It is a hands-on dive into **applying data science to solve real challenges** in education. This repo documents our learning + research journey as we built the system.
